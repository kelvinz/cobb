# compact

Keep `tasks/context.md` short and scannable by consolidating older entries into readable summaries.

---

## Guardrails

- Do not change product scope or implementation code.
- Do not move or rename PRDs here; completed PRDs are archived during `commit` finalise.
- Do not create separate context archive files.
- Ask for explicit confirmation before applying consolidation edits.
- Always propose retention/consolidation counts first; let the user choose the final numbers.
- When asking for user decisions, provide numbered short-reply options (e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`).

---

## Workflow

1. Preflight:
   - Ensure `tasks/` exists.
   - Inspect `tasks/context.md`.
   - Count entries to compact in `tasks/context.md`: `Key decisions`, `Completed`, `Notes / gotchas`.
2. Propose consolidation options and ask for a decision:
   - Suggest how many entries to keep in full detail vs consolidate into summary.
   - Provide recommended defaults, then allow user override (more or fewer).
3. Compact `tasks/context.md` in place:
   - Preserve `Project` and `Current state` sections.
   - Keep the user-selected number of most recent detailed entries (entries are newest-first, so keep from the top).
   - Before consolidating, extract still-relevant risks, open questions, or gotchas
     from older entries (bottom of each section).
   - Move them into `Notes / gotchas` or `Current state: Blockers` so they are not lost.
   - Replace older entries with a concise historical summary block appended at the bottom of each section.
4. Report results:
   - Show retained vs consolidated counts.
   - Call out any sections intentionally left untouched.

---

## Suggested Defaults

Use these as initial recommendations, then ask the user to confirm or adjust:

- `tasks/context.md`:
  - Keep the latest 10 entries in detail across historical sections.
  - Consolidate older entries into summary.

---

## References

- `references/compact-templates.md`: threshold-choice prompt and historical-summary examples.

---

## Output

- Update only `tasks/context.md`.
- Return:
  - proposed numbers and user-selected numbers
  - retained vs consolidated counts
  - concise summary of what changed
- End with a short status block:
  - **Files changed**: list of created/updated files
  - **Key decisions**: any assumptions or choices made (if any)
  - **Next step**: recommended next skill or action
