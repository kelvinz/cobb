# Static Canvas Workflow

Use this flow for posters, visual art sheets, editorial covers, and other static artifacts.

## Output Types

Produce:

1. a design philosophy `.md`
2. one `.png` or `.pdf` artifact (unless multi-page is requested)

## Step 1: Create the Visual Philosophy

Write the philosophy before drawing:

1. name the movement in 1-2 words
2. write 4-6 concise paragraphs covering form, space, color, rhythm, hierarchy, and material feel
3. emphasize meticulous craftsmanship and refinement
4. keep language visual-first, not explanatory prose
5. leave room for interpretation while staying specific

## Step 2: Extract a Subtle Conceptual Thread

Derive a subtle, non-literal conceptual thread from the brief:

1. recognizable to people familiar with the context
2. still powerful for people without that context
3. embedded through form, color, rhythm, and composition rather than explicit explanation

## Step 3: Compose the Artifact

Default to one page unless the user requests more.

1. prioritize composition, shape, pattern, atmosphere, and spatial hierarchy
2. keep text minimal; treat text as visual material
3. keep all elements inside canvas boundaries with deliberate margins
4. avoid overlap/cropping mistakes and preserve breathing room
5. use a limited but intentional palette
6. use repeated motifs to build coherence
7. choose typography intentionally; avoid generic defaults
8. keep sophistication high even for pop-culture subjects

When local fonts are available, prefer curated sets under a project-local `fonts/` directory.

## Step 4: Mandatory Refinement Pass

Run one additional pass focused on polish, not new elements:

1. tighten alignment and spacing rhythm
2. improve contrast hierarchy and readability
3. remove clutter and weak details
4. increase crispness and finish quality

If the instinct is to add new shapes, first attempt to improve the existing composition.

## Multi-Page Extension

When multiple pages are requested:

1. preserve the same philosophy across pages
2. vary pacing, composition, and focal strategy
3. make each page distinct while clearly part of one series
