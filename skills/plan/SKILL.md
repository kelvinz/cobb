description: "Create a Product Requirements Document (prd) / feature plan for a new or existing item (`Type: feat` / `fix` / `chore`). Use when planning scope, writing requirements, defining user stories + acceptance criteria, or turning an idea into an implementable spec. Triggers: plan, prd, product requirements, feature spec, bugfix spec, fix spec, requirements doc, spec this feature, write requirements."
---

# plan

Create a clear, implementation-ready prd for a single feature (not code).

---

## Guardrails

- Do not implement the feature.
- If the user asks to implement, propose writing a prd first (or ask if they want to skip the prd).
- Prefer asking a small number of high-value questions; otherwise write a draft prd with explicit assumptions.
- Write the prd so a junior dev (or another AI) can implement it without extra context (plain language, explicit edge cases, verifiable acceptance criteria).

---

## Workflow

1. Identify the feature:
   - Prefer a feature ID like `f-01` if available.
   - If `tasks/todo.md` exists, use the matching feature entry as the baseline for outcome + scope.
   - If the feature entry includes `Type:`, carry it into the prd Summary so `implement` can branch and implement appropriately.
   - If `Type:` is missing, assume `Type: feat`.
   - If `tasks/todo.md` is missing or the feature is not in it yet, stop and use `new` to add the feature to `tasks/todo.md` first.
   - If `tasks/memory.md` exists, skim relevant key decisions / notes before finalising requirements.
2. Check priority (if `tasks/todo.md` exists):
   - Priority is determined by list order (higher in the list = higher priority).
   - If there are higher-priority unchecked items above this feature, ask the user to confirm they want to proceed (vs writing a prd for one of the higher-priority items first). Mention the higher-priority IDs/names.
   - If the user says this item is urgent, recommend switching to `new` to move it higher in `tasks/todo.md`, then return to `plan`.
3. Determine the prd file path:
   - If the feature entry in `tasks/todo.md` already has a `prd:` line, use that path.
   - Otherwise use `tasks/f-##-<feature-slug>.md` (include the feature ID in the filename).
4. If a prd already exists at that path, update it in place (do not create a duplicate prd unless the user asks). Do not reset any status checklists inside the prd.
5. Ask essential clarifying questions (lettered options) only when needed.
6. Confirm scope boundaries (in-scope vs non-goals) and success metrics.
7. Write or update the prd at the chosen path (create `tasks/` if missing):
   - Ensure the prd includes `## Execution Status` (add it if missing; do not reset checkboxes if present).
   - If `tasks/todo.md` lists `Dependencies:` for this feature, include them in "Dependencies & Constraints" (dependency validation happens during `implement`).
8. If `tasks/todo.md` exists, update it to reflect the prd:
   - Check the feature checkbox (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`).
   - Add/update a `prd: \`<path>\`` line under that feature.
9. Reply with the file path and a short summary + open questions.

---

## Clarifying Questions (Only If Needed)

Ask up to ~7 questions. Use numbered questions with A/B/C/D options and an **Other** option so the user can reply like `1B, 2D, 3A`.

Cover only what is ambiguous:

- which feature this prd is for (feature ID/name)
- user + use case
- problem + desired outcome
- scope boundaries (in scope vs out of scope)
- whether this is `Type: feat` vs `fix` vs `chore`
- feature dependencies (by feature ID)
- conflicts with existing decisions/constraints (from `tasks/memory.md`)
- platforms/surfaces
- data + permissions
- integrations / external dependencies
- success metrics
- rollout constraints / timeline

### Example question format

```text
1. What is the primary goal?
   A. Enable a new capability
   B. Improve an existing workflow
   C. Reduce cost / time / errors
   D. Other: [describe]
```

## prd Template (Markdown)

Write the prd using this default structure. Drop sections that truly do not apply, but prefer completeness.

```markdown

### Acceptance criteria examples

- Bad: "Export works."
- Good: "When a user clicks **Export CSV**, the app downloads a CSV that includes columns A/B/C in that order; if there are 0 rows, download still occurs with headers only; errors show a non-blocking toast with retry."

---

## Output

- Create or reuse `tasks/`.
- Save/update the prd at the chosen path (prefer existing `prd:` path in `tasks/todo.md`; otherwise `tasks/f-##-<feature-slug>.md`).
- If the slug or scope is ambiguous, ask the user to confirm before saving.
- If `tasks/todo.md` exists, update it (check the feature + link the prd).
- If the prd introduces durable decisions/constraints, capture them in `tasks/memory.md` via `memory`.

---

## Todo Sync (If `tasks/todo.md` Exists)

- Update `tasks/todo.md` in place; do not reformat the whole file.
- Find the matching feature by ID (preferred) or by feature name.
- Update the feature checklist item to checked (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`). In `tasks/todo.md`, checked means "prd exists" (not "built").
- Ensure the feature has a `prd: \`<path>\`` line; add/update it if missing or wrong.
- Preserve the feature's `Type:` / `Dependencies:` lines as-is unless the user explicitly asked to change them.
- Preserve the feature's status indicator (`—` / `🔨` / `✅`) as-is; status is managed by `implement` and `commit`.
- If the feature is not present in `tasks/todo.md`, do not create a prd yet—use `new` to add the feature first, then return to `plan`.

---

## Quality Checklist

Before saving the prd:

- [ ] If a prd already existed, it was updated in place (no duplicates).
- [ ] If updating an existing prd, keep existing execution status checkboxes (do not reset them).
- [ ] prd includes `## Execution Status`.
- [ ] prd Summary includes `Type:`.
- [ ] If the feature has dependencies in `tasks/todo.md`, they are referenced by ID and included in "Dependencies & Constraints".
- [ ] prd is consistent with `tasks/memory.md` (or the change is captured via `memory`).
- [ ] Goals are measurable and directly tied to success metrics.
- [ ] Non-goals are explicit (prevent scope creep).
- [ ] User stories are checklist items with verifiable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Requirements are numbered (FR/NFR) and unambiguous.
- [ ] Edge cases, error states, and permissions are specified.
- [ ] Rollout plan and rollback plan exist (if risk warrants it).
- [ ] Saved/updated at the chosen prd path.
- [ ] If `tasks/todo.md` exists, the feature is checked and links to this prd.
